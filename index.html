 <p id="cricket_momentspara"> One day there was a match between our team and other team. There was a match of 10 overs. We had to bat first.
     I do not remember the total which was put for them to chase. But this 
     is where the moment was. At one point the opponent were scoring very fast and it looked like we were going to lose the match. And one thing important i forgot to tell you that this was the match for our cricket pitch. And we had 3 series in which if either of the teams won more series then that team will play on this pitch. so we had lost the first series and this was the second series going on. Each series had 3 matches. This was the 2nd match of 2nd series and it was a do or die match as we lost the first match of that 2nd series and if we lose this match we were going to lose this pitch. So I was saying that we were going to lose the match as were scoring very fast. After then the captain of our team handed the ball to me and said me to bowl the 6th or 7th over. And at that times i was not bowling well and not even batting or fielding well. I thought that this is the opportunity to bring back the form in atleast my bowling.And that happened. I gave only 1 or 2 runs and the most important part is that I also took 2 wickets in 
     that over on consective deliveries. I was really happy at that moment. But sadly i did not got my hattrick :(. And that was when I started to bowl well and took regular wickets.  </p>
